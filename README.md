## INTRODUCTION

This program suite provides comprehensive date calculation capabilities for the SwissMicros DM32 calculator, replicating and extending the date functions found on the classic HP-12C financial calculator. The programs enable date arithmetic, day-of-week determination, and liturgical calendar calculations.

### Purpose

The program enables users to:

- Calculate days between two dates
- Add or subtract days from a given date
- Determine day of week for any date
- Calculate Easter Sunday for any year
- Calculate major Catholic moveable feast dates

### Date Format

All dates use the format **M.DDYYYY** where:

- **M** = Month (1-12)
- **DD** = Day (01-31)
- **YYYY** = Year (four digits)

**Examples:**
- March 15, 2024 = `3.152024`
- December 25, 2025 = `12.252025`

### System Requirements

SwissMicros DM32 calculator with RPN operating system. Program requires approximately 437 program steps.

**Note:** When the statefile is loaded, Flag 1 (F1) is set by default, enabling automatic day-of-week calculation with LBL D. Clear Flag 1 with `[CF] [1]` if this feature is not desired.

---

## THEORY OF OPERATIONS

### Julian Day Number (JDN)

The core of all date calculations is the Julian Day Number system, a continuous count of days since January 1, 4713 BCE (proleptic Julian calendar). By converting calendar dates to JDN, date arithmetic becomes simple integer addition and subtraction.

The programs use the proleptic Gregorian calendar algorithm with a reference offset of 1721119 (representing March 1, 0000 in the computational calendar). This approach correctly handles:

- Leap years (including century exceptions)
- Variable month lengths
- Calendar transitions across millennia

### Date-to-JDN Conversion Algorithm

The conversion treats January and February as months 13 and 14 of the previous year to simplify leap year handling. The algorithm applies corrections for:

- 400-year cycle (146097 days)
- 4-year cycle (1461 days)
- Month-day offset within year

### Easter Computus

Easter calculation uses the Meeus/Jones/Butcher algorithm, an optimized method for determining Easter Sunday under the Gregorian calendar rules. The algorithm accounts for:

- Golden Number (19-year Metonic cycle)
- Solar and lunar corrections
- Century adjustments
- Leap year effects

Easter is defined as the first Sunday following the first ecclesiastical full moon occurring on or after the vernal equinox (nominally March 21).

### Modulo Operation

Since the HP-32SII and DM32 lack a native modulo function, the program implements MOD(P, I) as: `P - (IP(P/I) × I)`. This operation is fundamental to calendar calculations and day-of-week determination.

---

## VARIABLE DEFINITIONS

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **X, Y, Z, T** | Original date storage (preserves input during conversions) |
| **I** | Modulo divisor (temporary in MOD function) |
| **P** | Modulo dividend (temporary in MOD function) |
| **D** | Date temporary storage (day-of-week routine) |
| **W** | Day of week result (0-6: Sun-Sat, or 1-7) |
| **E** | Easter Sunday date (M.DDYYYY format) |
| **H** | Ash Wednesday date (Easter - 46 days) |
| **N** | Ascension Thursday date (Easter + 49 days) |
| **C** | Corpus Christi date (Easter + 60 days) |

**Note:** Registers X, Y, Z, T store the original date input (and year for Easter functions) to preserve values during internal conversions between calendar date and Julian Day Number formats.

## PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS

### User Programs

These are the primary functions called directly by users:

#### LBL N - Days Between Dates (ΔDYS)

Calculates the number of days between two dates. Equivalent to HP-12C ΔDYS function.

- **Inputs:** Date1 (Y register), Date2 (X register)
- **Output:** Number of days (signed integer)
- **Operation:** Converts both dates to JDN and returns the difference

#### LBL D - Date Arithmetic

Adds or subtracts days from a date. Equivalent to HP-12C DATE function.

- **Inputs:** Date (Y register), Days (X register, ± for backward)
- **Output:** New date in M.DDYYYY format
- **Flag F1:** When set, also returns day of week in register W

#### LBL E - Easter Date Calculator

Calculates Easter Sunday for a given year using the Meeus/Jones/Butcher algorithm.

- **Input:** Year (YYYY format, e.g., 2024)
- **Output:** Easter date in M.DDYYYY format (stored in register E)

#### LBL C - Catholic Holy Days Calculator

Calculates four major Catholic moveable feast dates based on Easter.

- **Input:** Year (YYYY format)
- **Outputs (stack, bottom to top):**
  - **X:** Ash Wednesday (Easter - 46 days)
  - **Y:** Easter Sunday
  - **Z:** Ascension Thursday (Easter + 49 days)
  - **T:** Corpus Christi (Easter + 60 days)
- **Registers:** H=Ash Wed, E=Easter, N=Ascension, C=Corpus Christi

#### LBL B - Days from Reference Date

Calculates days between input date and a customizable reference date. The Apollo 11 moon landing (July 20, 1969 = 7.201969) is set by default as an example, but this should be personalized to any significant date: your birthday, an anniversary, an important event, or countdown date.

- **Input:** Date (M.DDYYYY format)
- **Output:** Number of days from reference date
- **Customization:** Edit line 2 of LBL B to change reference date (default: 7.201969)

### Internal Subroutines

These functions are called internally and should not be executed directly by users:

- **LBL J:** Date to Julian Day Number converter
- **LBL G:** Julian Day Number to date converter
- **LBL M:** Modulo (remainder) function helper
- **LBL O:** Easter computus core algorithm
- **LBL W:** Day of week calculator (when F1 is set)
- **LBL K, H, P, Q, R, S, T:** Internal branching labels

### Flag F1 - Day of Week

**Flag 1 is SET BY DEFAULT** when the statefile is loaded.

When Flag 1 is set, LBL D automatically calculates day of week:
- `[RCL] [W]` - View day of week (0-6 or 1-7)
- `[CF] [1]` - Clear flag to disable feature
- `[SF] [1]` - Set flag to re-enable feature

### Register Storage

After running LBL C (Catholic Holy Days):
- `[RCL] [H]` - Ash Wednesday
- `[RCL] [E]` - Easter Sunday
- `[RCL] [N]` - Ascension Thursday
- `[RCL] [C]` - Corpus Christi

### Important Notes

- Dates must be entered in M.DDYYYY format (no separators between components)
- Use `[+/-]` to make days negative for backward date arithmetic
- Flag 1 is SET BY DEFAULT - LBL D automatically calculates day of week (disable with `[CF] [1]`)
- Programs handle leap years automatically per Gregorian calendar rules
- Easter calculations valid for years 1583 forward (Gregorian calendar adoption)
- Catholic holy days are calculated relative to Easter Sunday
- LBL B reference date (7.201969) is an example - customize to your own significant date
