# AllDates Statefile

*Made by jacober-calc for the SwissMicros DM32*

## Note from the Author

You will find the most recent version and information on this Statefile in this GitHub repo. While the file is hosted on the [official SwissMicros forum](https://forum.swissmicros.com), we do not guarentee that any version other than what is found here is the most up to date. Additionally, any reports on issue or bugs with the program, including contributions on further developments, will only be actioned via this GitHub repo. Thank you for being interested in the **astrodynamics32 Statefile** project and helping to make the state file more useful for users to come!

## Install and Download

You can find instructions on how to install .d32 Statefiles to your calculator [via the DM32 User Manual](https://technical.swissmicros.com/dm32/doc/dm32_user_manual.html#_saving_and_loading_a_state). The process is extremely simple. You can download the .zip file from the release page from this GitHub repository.

Consulting this **Readme.md** before use is highly recommended. The program is simple enough to use, but the readme contains useful information. The file you will want to install on your calculator from the .zip file is **AllDates.d32**.

## Date Programs Credit

This statefile is comprised of programs which have been ported from worked done by [Christoph Giesselink](https://archived.hpcalc.org/hp42s/programs/date/date.html) and [Andy Schick](https://www.hpmuseum.org/software/32s2dtvm.htm) for the HP42s and HP32sii respectively. For this statefile I have borrowed from the work largely done by Giesselink and used a modulo program and Easter calculation program from Schick and put them both together in a single statefile that can be used on the DM32 calculator. The end result is a statefile that provides date functionality similar to that of the HP12c.
